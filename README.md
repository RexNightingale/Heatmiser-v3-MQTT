# Heatmiser-v3-MQTT
Python Code to interact with the Heatmiser v3 Thermostats and interface with an MQTT Broker

After finding limitations on various implementations of code to interact with the Heatmiser v3 Thermostats, I decided to coble together my own variation and building on the work done by various folk and borrowing various pieces of code (and therefore recognition to the following is needed for the inspiration):
- Neil Trimboy
- Andy Lockran

I have finally come up with a small Python bit of code to interact with the Heatmiser v3 Thermostats using an IP to RS485 converter and to use an MQTT Broker to act as the external interface to any home automation applications.

I will confess that I am only a hobbyist and therefore the code may not be optimal but it works for what I require.

I will provide more details on the total project shortly.
